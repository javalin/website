## Changes since 3.X

**4.0.0.ALPHA4 (15th of July)**
* New routing! Path parms have been changed from `:param` to `{param}`,
  and a new syntax has been introduced to allow path params with slashes (`<param>`).
  This also makes it possible to create paths like `/{p1}AND{p2}`, or `/{filename}.{extension}`.
* All reified methods on `Context` have been brought back with the `asClass` suffix (ex. `ctx.queryParamAsClass<Int>("key")`)
* Static `JavalinJson` is gone, replaced by `config.jsonMapper(jsonMapper)`
* Added streaming methods to `JsonMapper`, these are optional methods for reducing memory usage
* The `sessionAttribute("key" consume = true)` method has been renamed to `consumeSessionAttribute("key")`
* Added a `Plugin` for setting security headers
* You can now set custom errors for async timeouts
* Fixed context-path bug in MicroMeter plugin
* Added missing `@JvmOverloads` to `HttpResponseException`
* The `Context` argument is now optional in `FileRenderer`
* A ton of internal refactoring

ALPHA4 is intended to be the last alpha release of Javalin 4, next up is RC0!

**4.0.0.ALPHA3 (22nd of June):**
* Added `cachedSessionAttribute` method to `Context`,
  which caches session-attributes as request-attributes.
* The `removeCookie` method in `Context` now uses `/` as the default path
* the `HandlerType` of a handler is now available in the `Context`
* Validation has been completely reworked
* Route declarations now take `Role...` instead of `Set<Role`
* Attributes on `Javalin` now have the same signature as attributes on `Context`
* The `Context#result(Future)` and `Context#json(Future)` methods have been replace
  by `Context#future(Future)` and `Context#future(Future, Consumer)`. The consumer
  runs after the future has completed and accepts the result of the future as an argument.
  There is a default `Consumer` which makes `Context#future` work identical to both
  `Context#result(Future)` and `Context#json(Future)` from Javalin 3
* Fixed a bug in OpenAPI with schema annotations for `Instant` not working
* Fixed wrong error message if there was a port collision between a custom Jetty Server
  and a default Jetty server
* Jetty's `TimeoutException`s are now ignored instead of logged as error
* The `CorsPlugin` now sets the `Vary` header
* The default port is now `8080` to align with other JVM frameworks
* The default server no longer sends the `Server` header

**4.0.0.ALPHA2 (26th of May):**
* A new module with test tools has been added (`javalin-testtools`) - see API in
  [PR](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/pull/1251#issue-646087985)
* A Loom ThreadPool (virtual threads) is now used by default (if runtime has Loom)
* Kotlin has been bumped to 1.5.0, and tests now run against JDK 15
* Static-files config has been reworked. All global config options have been removed, and
  it's now possible to set headers per handler. The "immutable" folder convention has been removed
* You can now consume a session attribute by passing a boolean (`ctx.sessionAttribute(key = "key", consume = true)`)
* JavalinVue's configuration has been reworked, it's no longer possible to set things in the wrong order
* Added a `JavalinLogger` to easily enable/disable all of Javalin's logging
* GraphQL now supports operation names
* The `cookie(name, value)` method will now **set** instead of **add**
  (meaning you can no longer end up with two cookies with the same name)
* The included rate-limiter has been renamed to `NaiveRateLimiter`,
  to further underline its limits
* The Javalin version is now logged on startup
* `Javalin#config` has been renamed to `Javalin#_conf` to avoid people accidentally using it

**4.0.0.ALPHA1 (18th of April):**
* You can now validate empty strings in `Validator`
* Content-Type can now be null for `UploadedFile`
* `WsHandler` is now `WsConfig`
* Context extensions (`Context#register`/`Context#use`) have been removed
* JavalinVue now supports Vue3
* Exceptions while writing responses in async mode are now handled gracefully
* Can now set explicit "includes" in OpenAPI (ex: `.includePath("/api")`
* Added option to log Jetty info during startup
* Removed dependency on Jetty from OpenAPI plugin

**4.0.0.ALPHA0 (17th of February):**
This version is very similar to 3.13.3 (the last 3x version).

There is one breaking change, which is the extraction of inline reified functions from `Context` and `WsContext`.
These functions lead to non-deterministic behavior in Mockk and Mockito, which made it hard to write mock tests.

Jackson has been bumped to 2.12.1, which actually required bumping to Kotlin 1.4 too.

The `HttpResponseException` class now properly serializes the details map to an object, rather than an array of key/value pairs.
